# 1. Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial sector. Detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial to protect users and institutions. In this tutorial, we'll build a machine learning model to detect fraud and deploy it using Streamlit, a popular framework for building interactive web applications.

# 2. Data Preparation
We start by preparing the dataset. We'll use Jupyter Notebook to clean and preprocess the data.
