# Building-a-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-App-From-Data-Preparation-to-Deployment
In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a credit card fraud detection app using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Streamlit. We will cover data preparation, model training, and deploying the app. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional web app that can predict credit card fraud based on transaction details.

# 1. Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial sector. Detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial to protect users and institutions. In this tutorial, we'll build a machine learning model to detect fraud and deploy it using Streamlit, a popular framework for building interactive web applications.

# 2. Data Preparation
We start by preparing the dataset. We'll use Jupyter Notebook to clean and preprocess the data.

## Step 1: Import Libraries and Load Data
First, import the necessary libraries and load the datasets.

## Step 2: Handle Categorical Variables and Balance the Dataset
We encode the categorical variables and balance the dataset to handle the imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

# 3. Model Training
Next, we train multiple machine learning models and select the best one based on performance.

## Step 1: Train Multiple Models
We will train various models and evaluate their performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
